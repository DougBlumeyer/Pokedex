# Pokedex

An AppAcademy exercise I did to solidify my understanding of Ajax and jQuery living on top of Rails, before we dove into Backbone.js.

## Day 1

I was quite proud of myself for creating fields that become editable when you click on them. Of course Backbone views handle this much better than the way I figured how to do it this day, which was manually overwriting HTML directly on the DOM.

## Day 2

Finally integrated Backbone!
